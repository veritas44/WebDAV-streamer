## WebDAV streamer ##
WebDAV streamer is a simple PHP web application for streaming music and video from a WebDAV share (like ownCloud) to the browser. It only requires PHP and ffmpeg, and setting it up should not take too long.

**How to set it up?**

 1. Rename config.example.php to config.php
 2. Fill in the variables with your own details
 3. Enjoy

Please bear in mind that running this on a hosting with bandwith limiter is not recommended, because it first downloads the file, and then streams it, so the bandwith will be double the file size.

If you need any assistance, please contact me.
